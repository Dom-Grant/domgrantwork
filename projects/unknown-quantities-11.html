    Unknown Quantities (UQ) is a yearly journal, created as a collaboration between the <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/communication-and-graphic-design/postgraduate/ma-graphic-communication-design-csm" target="_blank">MA GCD</a> and <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/curation-and-culture/postgraduate/ma-culture-criticism-and-curation-csm" target="_blank">MA CCC</a> courses at Central Saint Martins.<br>
    Each year a handful of students are selected from both courses, and given free reign to create an experimental publication on any topic.<br>
    <br>
    For the 11th edition, our chosen theme was time. Specifically <u>the way time can manifest both pysically and emotionally</u>.<br>
    <br>
    UQ11 pays tribute to the conept of time through several design decisions:
    <ul>
        <li>The publication has no cover and is spiral bound, invoking both the circularity and the forward march of time. UQ11 invites the reader to navigate the magazine freely with no begining or end.</li>
        <li>The 24 pieces split into seven 12-page sections evoke the day/night cycle, the clock, the calendar day, week, month, and year.</li>
        <li>As UQ11 was printed, the risograph ink fluctuated throughout the run, fading and intensifying at different times. The soy-based ink can smudge at any time after printing, so each copy will change depending now how it is handled.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

        The UQ11 launch event was hosted on the 26th January 2024, at Kiosk N1C, Coal Drops Yard, London.
